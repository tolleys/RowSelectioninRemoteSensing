# Row Selection in Remote Sensing

Within this repository, we are sharing the R scripts used in the analysis for Row Selection in Remote Sensing for Maize and Sorghum. 

R scripts are provided to determine repeatability of each trait-date-experiment-rowsegment combination. Significant differences between row segment combinations were determined using 2.RowSelection_RepeatabilityDifferencesbyRowSegment_sat.R. Machine learning scripts are those that start with 3.
